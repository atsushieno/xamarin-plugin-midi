It is just an ongoing attempt to create mobile-centric x-plat MIDI library
which is based on Xamarin plugins
https://github.com/xamarin/XamarinComponents

Nothing works yet (not even Android). Many of those are just generated from
Xamarin plugins template. Usable documentation and samples would come later.
